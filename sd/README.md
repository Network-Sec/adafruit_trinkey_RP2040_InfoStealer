is the actual "storage" folder of the Trinkey. We supply you with Microsoft's original "rg.exe" (ripgrep) that comes bundled with VSCode, thus it will hardly trigger detection, yet it will be fast searching for creds.

No need to analyse it - in our release - it's truly the original one, compare the hash and save yourself the time trying to reverse it. :D Same is true for the lib folder contents. We don't release backdoor'd stuff. Whitehat, remember. Bit grey...ish lately, but still counting as white.
